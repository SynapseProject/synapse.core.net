  "body": "# Welcome to Synapse\r\n\r\nSynapse is a lightweight execution engine designed to take data from disparate, federated sources and connect it to a process.  Synapse is built to run as a local or remote process.\r\n\r\n## Elements\r\n\r\nA Synapse workflow, called a `Plan`, is comprised of a hierarhy of Actions.  An `Action` is essentially the definition of a local or remote process and the parameters required to initiate it.  Plans are declared in YAML, as follows:\r\n\r\n```css\r\nAction:\r\n- Name: {string, friendly name}\r\n  Proxy: {uri, remote Synapse node}\r\n  ExecuteCase: {enum, status value}\r\n  Handler:\r\n    Type: {library}:{module}\r\n    Config: {ParameterInfo}\r\n  Parameters: {ParameterInfo}\r\n  RunAs: {SecurityContext}\r\n```\r\nWhere, `ParameterInfo` is:\r\n```css\r\n    Name: {string, friendly name}\r\n    Type: {enum, Xml | Yaml | Json}\r\n    Uri: {http:// | file://}\r\n    Values:\r\n      {Block of directly declared Xml|Yaml|Json as specified by Type}\r\n    Dynamic:\r\n    - Name: {friendly name}\r\n      Path: {XPath or root:path0:path1}\r\n      Options:\r\n      - Key: {key}\r\n        Value: {display value}\r\n```\r\nAnd `SecurityContext` is:\r\n```css\r\n    Name: {string, friendly name}\r\n    Password: {ecrypted string}\r\n    Provider: {Active Directory | AWS | Azure}\r\n    Config: {ParameterInfo}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEssentially, Synapse takes data from various federated sources, provides the data to an action, and executes the action under a given security context.\r\n\r\n## Components\r\n\r\n| Component | Description\r\n|--------|--------\r\n|Synapse.Core|Contains the workflow execution engine and is responsible for initiating calls to sub-processes.\r\n|Synapse.CommandLine|A CLI wrapper on Synapse.Core for local process execution.\r\n|Synapse.Server|A server daemon designed to act as remote Synapse.Core agent.\r\n|Synapse.Enterprise|An API interface to creating, storing, and executing Synapse Plans under an RBAC.  Manages exection log-capture and keeps detailed audit logs.",
